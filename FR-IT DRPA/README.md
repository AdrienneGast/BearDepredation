This repository contains the workflow, scripts and descrpition of depredation risk probability analysis (*DRPA*) by the brown bear conducted in the Pyrenees (France, Spain, Andorra) and in the Italian Alps (Trentino). This analysis has been conducted similarly on both areas in order to compare results and the goodness of predictions if applied on other populations. In terms of management recommandations, it is mainly about the possibility of making strong management recommandations from a small population at a large scale (Europe).
You will find in this repository:
- the creation of covariates     
- the creation of the data set on both sides (occurence)
- the modeling workflow  

We conducted this study mainly on R version 3.5 (CoreTeam,2017) and with QGis version 3.4 ().
