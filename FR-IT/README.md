This is the folder to compute variables for depredation factor analysis between France and Italy.

## STUDY AREA


## LandCover variables computed for analysis

1. **TREE COVER DENSITY**
    1. From Copernicus download E30N20 raster for TCD at 20m resolution (2015)
    https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/high-resolution-layers/forests/tree-cover-density/status-maps/2015

    2. Reduce raster (crop and mask) to the large area of analysis (raster_base.tif) 
    to see how raster_base is created please refer to [STUDY AREA](#Study_area)
    
    3. *Create raster of non tcd* : 

2. **AGRICULTURAL TREES**
''
"FASDL_maskrasterbase@1"  = 3  OR 
"vine_maskrasterbase@1" = 1
''
